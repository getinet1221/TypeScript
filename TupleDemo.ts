// Tuple's demo in typescript
// fixed elements and know types
// can be mixed and its order has meaning
// e.g. show name and age if an employee
var nameWithAage: [string, number]= ["Getinet", 23];// declare the variable with two types
console.log("Lets acccess it with index : "+nameWithAage[0]);// we can acccess it via array like things
console.log("output : "+nameWithAage);
